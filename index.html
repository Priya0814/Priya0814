                <p>My name is Priya Govil, and I am studying Computer Science at <a class="caption" href="http://www.johnabbott.qc.ca/">John Abbott College</a>. My first year of college is almost over and it's been an amazing experience so far. We get to learn so much about all the different fields in Computer Science which makes it even more interesting. In my second semester, we have started to learn html and css to design different websites with hero images, flexbox and CSS Grid. I enjoy this class a lot and I think I love it more than programming sometimes because I get to be creative with the designs of the different pages that I create.</p>

                <p>Other passions: Something I love to do when I am coding or making new websites is listening to music. I have always been a big fan of music and it always helps me concentrate more when I am doing work. On my free time, I also enjoy gaming on my mobile or PC and I also love to bake to make some delicious deserts.</p>
