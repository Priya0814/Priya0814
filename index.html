                    <p> My name is <strong>Priya Govil</strong>, and I am a Computer Science student in my final year at 
                        <a class="caption" href="http://www.johnabbott.qc.ca/" target="_blank">John Abbott College</a>. 
                        I enjoy developing applications, websites and games that make life easy and fun!
                        I'm very passionate about learning new things each and day through my studies and work.
                    </p>
                    
                    <p> I have always been fascinated by technology and throughout my college experience I have been able to learn all about it. Currently, I am experienced
                        with C#, Java, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, Application & Web Development, Databases, Data Structures & Algorithms, as well as various different tools and
                        frameworks like GitHub, Jira, Microsoft Azure, ASP.NET, Entity Framework Core, MVP, MVC, WPF & many more. I also have work experience as a full stack
                        developer intern which has allowed me to learn a lot about the development process.           
                    </p>

                    <p> 
                        In my free time, I love to read about the tech world as new innovations and changes in the Computer Science field come up constantly 
                        and its important to stay up to date. I also love to try new recipes and bake whenever I get the chance, as well as play video games and travel the world. 
                        I also enjoy meeting new people and making connections, so don't hesitate to contact me through LinkedIn if you would like to know more about me or work with me!
