                    <p>I am really fascinated with Artificial Intelligence as many companies have been making different software and machines that behave and think like humans which is why I really admire Pepper the robot which was created by <a class="description" href="https://www.softbankrobotics.com/">SoftBanks Robotics</a> and first introduced in 2014. <a class="description" href="https://www.softbankrobotics.com/emea/en/pepper">Pepper is the worldâ€™s first social humanoid robot able to recognize faces and basic human emotions. Pepper was optimized for human interaction and is able to engage with people through conversation and his touch screen.</a> I think that Pepper is truly fascinating as this robot is used by many schools and businesses.</p>

                    <p>Something I have always loved doing when I was younger was play Super Mario Bros with my family and since then I have always wished to invent a game like that which would bring happiness to others like Super Mario Bros made me happy. Shigeru Miyamoto is the inventor of this famous game and he has invented many other games with Nintendo like Donkey Kong and The Lengend of Zelda. He is very creative and his games have gained a lot of success and he is the one who made me think of going into Computer Science and possibly inventing a game.</p>

                    <p>As a girl in Computer Science I find it very encouraging to see other woman in this field who have been successful in a field dominated by men. Jade Raymond was born in Montreal and studied Computer Science at MCGIll University. She worked with Sony and later with Ubisoft as the Managing Director. Raymond is known by many gamers as she is the producer of Assassin's Creed which is a very popular game. She is a huge inspiration as she is a Montreal girl just like me and she has accomplished so much as a girl in Computer Science proving that women can also be very successful in this field.</p>

                    <p>One of the biggest influences in my decision to pursue a career in Computer Science is my dad who is a programmer. I have always seen my father work very hard since he immigrated to Canada from India to provide for our family and seeing him be so passionate about his work is really inspiring and I hope to be like him one day. I get to learn a lot from him everyday and I look up to him since I was a child.</p>
